About this project :-
+ It is a simple dynamic website which has the following specs.
+ Started with creating a dummy data in database for upto 10
customers. I used MySql for database.
  + Customers table will have basic fields such as name, email,
current balance, account no, address, phone no etc.
  + Transfers table will record all transfers
happened.
+ Flow: <br> *`Home Page` -> `View all Customers` -> `Select and View one
Customer` -> `Transfer Money` -> `Select customer to transfer to` ->
`View all Customers`.*
+ There is No Login Page. No User Creation. Only transfer of money
between multiple users.
